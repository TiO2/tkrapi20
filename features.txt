~/tkrapi20/features.txt

NOT DONE YET:
  
list of resources:
  /keras_nn/ABC/25/2016-11?features='pctlag1,slope4,moy'&hl=2&neurons=4
  
question:
  - how to create a 2 layer net having 1 neuron in output layer with linear output?
  - query of relu in keras help me?
  - yes, found linear(x) here: https://keras.io/activations/
  - can I have a 1-neuron output layer which outputs binary logistic regression?
  
Site should have list of behaviorial dimensions:
  - algo-types
  - ml-feature-names
  - training sizes
  - join candidates: gspc, gld, tlt, rut, xom
  - prediction types: pctlead-1day, pctlead-2day, pctlead-5day
  - tkr
  - month2predict
  
Site should have README.md
The README should list installation steps
Site should have features.txt



SHOULD BE DONE NOW:

Start features.txt
bitb repo: tkrapi20
README.md started
get tkrlist.txt from ~/tkrapi2/tkrlist.txt

Install cuda, tensorflow on dan@u78: DONE: ~dan/py36/, tensorflow-gpu (1.2.1)

Tinker with flask-restful to ensure it works:
  dict -> json
  static-json

write,run script to remove invalid tkrs from tkrlist.txt

Write retry_request_tkr.bash to get tkrs which need 2nd try
Enhance request_tkr.bash so it calls retry_request_tkr.bash to get tkrs which need 2nd try

Write retry_curl_tkrs.bash to get tkrs which need 2nd try
Enhance curl_tkrs.bash so it calls retry_curl_tkrs.bash  to get tkrs which need 2nd try

postgres account:
  tkrapi/tkrapi
  syntax:
    create role tkrapi with login super user password 'tkrapi';
    create database tkrapi;
  db_s = 'postgres://tkrapi:tkrapi@127.0.0.1/tkrapi'

request splits,div
enhance curl_tkr.bash

resources:
  /sklinear/IBM/25/2016-11?features='pctlag1,slope4,moy'
  /keras_linear/ABC/25/2016-11/'pctlag1,slope4,moy'

enhance predictions2db so it does delete and insert.
