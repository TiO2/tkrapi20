  - query of relu in keras help me?
  - yes, found linear(x) here: https://keras.io/activations/
  
Site should have list of behaviorial dimensions:
  - algo-types
  - ml-feature-names
  - training sizes
  - join candidates: gspc, gld, tlt, rut, xom
  - prediction types: pctlead-1day, pctlead-2day, pctlead-5day
  - tkr
  - month2predict
  
Site should have README.md
The README should list installation steps
Site should have features.txt



SHOULD BE DONE NOW:
Start features.txt
bitb repo: tkrapi20
README.md started
get tkrlist.txt from ~/tkrapi2/tkrlist.txt

Install cuda, tensorflow on dan@u78: DONE: ~dan/py36/, tensorflow-gpu (1.2.1)

Tinker with flask-restful to ensure it works:
  dict -> json
  static-json

write,run script to remove invalid tkrs from tkrlist.txt

Write retry_request_tkr.bash to get tkrs which need 2nd try
Enhance request_tkr.bash so it calls retry_request_tkr.bash to get tkrs which need 2nd try

Write retry_curl_tkrs.bash to get tkrs which need 2nd try
Enhance curl_tkrs.bash so it calls retry_curl_tkrs.bash  to get tkrs which need 2nd try
