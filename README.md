# README.md

This repo, tkrapi20, should drive an API service.

The code in this repo should be presented to a Meetup:

2017-08-24
Stock Market ML API with Flask-RESTful AND Keras-Tensor-Flow

Code development in this repo should be driven by a document:

features.txt

Some of features.txt depends on a description of the Meetup presentation:

meetup.txt

Note that I had started an earlier repos:
  * tkrapi in 2017-01 [ API server for the tkrz Rails app. ]
  * tkrapi2 in 2017-06-ish
  
Maybe someday I will merge the 3 repos.

Currently I have these:

  * git@bitbucket.org:bikle/tkrapi.git
  * git@bitbucket.org:bikle/tkrapi2.git
  * git@bitbucket.org:bikle/tkrapi20.git

This README.md is for tkrapi20.git
