The software in this repo was developed on Ubuntu 16.

If you want to run the demos on your laptop, you should install Ubuntu 16 on your laptop.

If you are on Mac or windows, a straightforward way to do this is to install VirtualBox.

After you install VirtualBox, download the file listed below and then import it into VirtualBox.

After you boot Ubuntu 16, you should see a login screen for an account named: 'ann'.
